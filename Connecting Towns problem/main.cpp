 Problem Statement
 
 Gandalf is travelling from Rohan to Rivendell to meet Frodo but there is no direct route from Rohan (T1) to Rivendell (Tn).
 
 But there are towns T2,T3,T4...Tn-1 such that there are N1 routes from Town T1 to T2, and in general, Ni routes from Ti to Ti+1 for i=1 to n-1 and 0 routes for any other Ti to Tj for j â‰  i+1
 
 Find the total number of routes Gandalf can take to reach Rivendell from Rohan.
 
 Note
 Gandalf has to pass all the towns Ti for i=1 to n-1 in numerical order to reach Tn.
 For each Ti , Ti+1 there are only Ni distinct routes Gandalf can take.
 
 Input Format
 The first line contains an integer T, T test-cases follow.
 Each test-case has 2 lines. The first line contains an integer N (the number of towns).
 The second line contains N - 1 space separated integers where the ith integer denotes the number of routes, Ni, from the town Ti to Ti+1
 
 Output Format
 Total number of routes from T1 to Tn modulo 1234567

 Constraints
 1 <= T<=1000
 2< N <=100
 1 <= Ni <=1000
